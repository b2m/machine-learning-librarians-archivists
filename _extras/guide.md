## Overview
- Content: This curriculum is comprehensive and for the most part is advanced for a complete beginner. Unless you are teaching a multi-day workshop series on this lesson, you will need to pick and choose which sections to include in the workshop.
- Exercises and interactivity: incorporating exercises and interactivity in this lesson is essential throughout in order to help learners stay involved
- Throughout the lesson, provide clear definitions for jargon terms. Differentiate between the terms ‘AI’ and ‘ML’ and be careful not to use them interchangeably. When speaking generally, use the broader term ‘AI’.
- 
### Lesson Planning (Content)
- Highlight some (or all) of the Learning Objectives to guide lesson planning
Consider whether there are new developments in AI/ML to incorporate (e.g. before we planned to teach the curriculum for the first time, Large Language Models (LLMs), generative AI, ChatGPT became extremely popular).
- Consider ways to make the lesson more interactive including hands-on exercises throughout.

### Lesson Planning (Structure)
- Incorporate visuals - a slidedeck to provide a visual guide throughout the lesson
- Begin with an interactive survey (e.g. Mentimeter) activity that gauges learners’ level of familiarity with curriculum topics or an activity such as Jargon Busting.
- Incorporate interactivity throughout the lesson through exercises and activities.
- Include examples of GLAM applications (possibly from your institution).
- Plan for a break each hour.
